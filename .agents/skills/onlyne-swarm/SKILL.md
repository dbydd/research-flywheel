# onlyne-swarm supervisor skill

## Audience

This skill is for the operator agent that owns the swarm root. It creates
workspace descriptions, syncs the tree, starts the scheduler, submits work,
and watches progress. It is not for an agent session running inside one
generated workspace. A worker session only reads its own task from the
follow-up queue and finishes with the plugin reply tools.

## Mental model

- Swarm root = scheduler cwd. Commands run at the root; nested starts refuse.
- Description = `.agents/.schedule/<path>/template.workspace.jsonc`.
- Instance = `.ws/<path>`, generated one way from descriptions.
- Root = supervisor workspace (`.`). It submits, watches the ledger, cancels.
- Agent workspace = generated worker. The scheduler owns its daemon, terminal,
  Pi session, and out routing.
- Task = Pi session (`task_id == session_id`). One session carries one hop.
- Downstream work = new tasks spawned with `transfer_send_to` lineage.
  Sessions never wait; results travel through files and the ledger.
- Driving work inside a task belongs to the pi-onlyne plugin tools, not to
  shell commands from the operator.

## Prerequisites

- `onlyne` reachable (`onlyne` in `PATH`, or `ONLYNE_BIN` set).
- `onlyne-swarm` reachable in `PATH`.
- Orca running with the `orca` CLI reachable.
- `pi` reachable with `pi-onlyne` installed.
- A configured Pi model/provider for real sessions.
- Short root path on macOS (Unix socket names have a short limit).

## Initialize a root

```bash
onlyne-swarm init
```

Behavior:

- Missing `.onlyne/config.toml` is created loopback-only with `[swarm]` on.
- An existing Onlyne workspace keeps adapters and secrets; `init` only flips
  `[swarm] enabled = true`.
- Missing `.agents/.schedule/planner/template.workspace.jsonc`,
  `.onlyne/swarm.workspace.jsonc`, and `.onlyne/.env` are created as a full
  starter. Existing files are never overwritten.
- Every template key ships with its default; delete anything unchanged.

## Write templates

Full starter keys: `$schema`, `name`, `role`, `model`, `back_edges`.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbydd/onlyne-swarm/main/template.workspace.schema.json",
  "name": "planner",
  "role": "You are the planner. Return a concise result.",
  "model": { "provider": "", "model": "", "effort": "" },
  "back_edges": []
}
```

Rules:

- Directory nesting is the tree: `a/b/template.workspace.jsonc` is `a/b`.
- Keep names path-safe; `.` means the root supervisor.
- `back_edges` are tree paths relative to the declaring workspace
  (`../reviewer`, `sibling/worker`). Cyclic edges are allowed.
- Missing edge targets fail `sync`; fix the path, do not invent retries.
- Ancestor templates contribute scalar fields only; `back_edges` never inherit.
- Hand-tune one instance in
  `.ws/<path>/.onlyne/swarm.workspace.jsonc`; sync keeps it.
- Validate templates against the GitHub-hosted `template.workspace.schema.json`.

## Generate and inspect the tree

```bash
onlyne-swarm workspace create
onlyne-swarm workspace sync
onlyne-swarm list --what workspaces
onlyne-swarm status
```

`sync` never deletes instances or hand-written overlays. Removed descriptions
stay on disk as `orphan-instance` alerts. Missing daemon sockets show as
`dangling-link` alerts. Generated agents use loopback only; external channels
stay on the root unless the operator enables them there.

## Run and submit

```bash
ONLYNE_BIN=/path/to/onlyne onlyne-swarm run
# or, to survive the launching shell:
ONLYNE_BIN=/path/to/onlyne onlyne-swarm run --detach
onlyne-swarm stop
```

Give the scheduler its own exclusive pane: foreground `run` is a foreground
process and Ctrl-C there stops the whole ring (`foreground scheduler in this
pane; keep it exclusive`). Never run it in a pane shared with other sessions,
and never probe a production root (e.g. a live flywheel) with shutdown or
reconcile tests — use a scratch root or `SWARM_STUB_AGENT=1`.

`run --detach` double-forks + setsid, writes `.onlyne/run/scheduler.pid`,
and logs to `.onlyne/logs/scheduler.log`; the launching shell returns
immediately and Ctrl-C there is harmless. `stop` sends SIGTERM, waits up to
5s for the scheduler's own shutdown (socket + pid unlinked), then SIGKILLs.
`status` with no live pid reports `no scheduler running` and exits non-zero,
so scripts can use it as an up-probe. It never deletes the socket: a stale
socket is taken over by the next `run`. Adoption is unchanged: restart
re-adopts live sessions either way.

swarm-ready gates apply equally to root and every instance:
`.onlyne/config.toml` has `[swarm] enabled = true`, `.pi/onlyne.json` has
`watch.autoStart = true`, `.pi/settings.json` `packages` include pi-onlyne.
Instances are backfilled by `run_sync`; root is operator-maintained —
`status` `not_swarm_ready` reports which gate root is missing. A relay back
to `_root` must pass root's gates too.

Then from another shell in the same root:

```bash
cat > payload.md <<'EOF'
Inspect the current build and return a short report.
EOF
onlyne-swarm submit --to planner --payload payload.md
onlyne-swarm list
onlyne-swarm list --state running
```

Client commands (`status`, `list`, `submit`, `cancel`, `tui`) also resolve the
nearest swarm root socket when run from `.ws/<role>`; the scheduler remains a
single root-owned process. `run` remains a root command and keeps its nested
start guard.

`run` syncs once, starts missing daemons, subscribes to priority event
streams, and serves `.onlyne/run/swarm.sock`. Each dispatch opens one Orca
terminal with `pi` (env `ONLYNE_SWARM_TASK` carries the assigned task id).
The session sends `swarm_ready`, claims exactly that env task from history
(stale history claims yield to it), receives the persisted payload through
follow-up, pins its tab title to `swarm:<to>:<id8>`, and completes through
the plugin swarm tools.

Reclaim is cooperative: when a hop ends (done, failed, cancelled), the
scheduler writes a `---swarm-ctl` recycle wire to the workspace loopback, the
session acks `swarm_recycled` and exits its own process, and only then does
the scheduler close the Orca tab. `swarm_quit` uses the same ack path. The
scheduler never injects shell kill commands; `cancel --force` is the operator
escape hatch and closes the tab immediately.

## Visibility in Orca

Hop terminals live under the swarm root worktree as background tabs titled
`swarm:<to>:<id8>` (session re-pins on claim and on idle; pi overwrites the
create-time title on boot). Same-workspace concurrent hops are sibling tabs
sharing the title prefix — find a session by title, not by sidebar structure.
Do NOT register folder-kind nodes: they are invisible in `worktree list` and
`terminal list` and render as Unknown ghosts; `sync` removes leftovers instead.
Set `SWARM_FOCUS=all` (or `new`) in the scheduler environment to reveal each
created terminal; leave it unset during fan-out.

## Monitor and cancel

```bash
onlyne-swarm status
onlyne-swarm list --state running
onlyne-swarm tui
onlyne-swarm cancel <task-id> --reason "manual stop"
onlyne-swarm cancel <task-id> --force --reason "stuck session"
```

`task_id` names the whole lineage family. Cyclic graphs run until the operator
cancels; there is no timeout, retry, or loop breaker. Cancelled tasks record
`swarm-cancelled` ledger rows; an exited session records `swarm-failed`.
Ledger tail is visible from `status` and the TUI.
## Refresh this skill

```bash
onlyne-swarm export-skill
```

The file lives at `.agents/skills/onlyne-swarm/SKILL.md` under the swarm
root. It is workspace-local; it never touches global skill directories.

## Common mistakes

- Starting the scheduler inside `.ws/...` instead of the root.
- Editing generated `.ws/` configs instead of the templates,
  then expecting `sync` to propagate the edit.
- Hand-writing a task header into loopback input instead of using `submit`.
- Treating `onlyne_in/<target>` as storage; it is a send-side symlink view.
- Opening the worker session manually and driving follow-ups by hand instead
  of letting the scheduler and plugin tools own delivery.
- Expecting the scheduler to retry failures; retry belongs to Pi-side plugins.
